              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                  RolloutRef is a reference to the Rollout object that this constraint applies to.
                  It must be in the same namespace as the RolloutConstraint.

                      This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                      allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                      almost certainly wrong.

                  WantedRelease indicates the release wanted by this constraint.
                  The Rollout controller determines which release to deploy by evaluating the priority of RolloutConstraints.
                  It favors the release wanted by the RolloutConstraint with the highest priority.
                  In cases where multiple RolloutConstraints have the same highest priority, the controller will proceed with deployment
                  only if all such constraints refer to the identical release.
