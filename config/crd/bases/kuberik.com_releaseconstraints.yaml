                      This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                      allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                      almost certainly wrong.

            properties:
              acceptedReleases:
                description: |-
                  AcceptedReleases lists the specific release versions explicitly allowed by this constraint.
                  The ReleaseDeployment controller selects a release based on constraint priority.
                  It chooses the first release listed in `AcceptedReleases` from the highest priority constraint.
                  If multiple constraints share the highest priority, the controller selects the first release
                  common to the intersection of their `AcceptedReleases` lists.
                  Inconsistent ordering of releases within this intersection across constraints can cause the deployment to stall.
