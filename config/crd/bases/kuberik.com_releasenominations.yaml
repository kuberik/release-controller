                      This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                      allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                      almost certainly wrong.

                  NominatedRelease indicates the release proposed by this resource.
                  The ReleaseDeployment controller determines which release to deploy by evaluating the priority of ReleaseNominations.
                  It favors the release nominated by the ReleaseNomination with the highest priority.
                  In cases where multiple ReleaseNominations have the same highest priority, the controller will proceed with deployment
                  only if all such nominations refer to the identical release.
