                  ControlGroups is a list of control groups that this control belongs to.
                  The order of control groups in the Rollout determines which control group takes precedence.

                  RolloutRef is a reference to the Rollout object that this control applies to.
                  It must be in the same namespace as the RolloutControl.

                      This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                      allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                      almost certainly wrong.

                  WantedRelease indicates the release wanted by this control.
                  The Rollout controller determines which release to deploy by evaluating the control groups.
                  It favors the release wanted by the RolloutControl in the highest priority control group (as defined in the Rollout).
                  In cases where multiple RolloutControls belong to the same highest priority control group, the controller will proceed with deployment
                  only if all such controls refer to the identical release.
